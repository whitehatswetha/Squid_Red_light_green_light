# Squid_Red_light_green_light

Squid games is a popular Netflix series. With growing demand for K-Pop the game has won a lot of fans all over the world. Children, especially teens, are great fans of this trend. I have decided to thereby use this game called “Red Light Green Light” to capture the interest of the children and also make them understand various javascript concepts through this game. Coupled by a suitable project it could be a win-win game to emphasize on the road safety and an attention grabber.
